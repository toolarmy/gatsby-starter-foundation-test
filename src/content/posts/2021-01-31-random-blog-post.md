***Rick and Morty*** is an American [adult animated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_animation "Adult animation") [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") [sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated_sitcom "Animated sitcom") created by [Justin Roiland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Roiland "Justin Roiland") and [Dan Harmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harmon "Dan Harmon") for [Cartoon Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Network "Cartoon Network")'s nighttime [Adult Swim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Swim "Adult Swim") programming block. The series follows the misadventures of cynical [mad scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_scientist "Mad scientist") [Rick Sanchez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Sanchez_(Rick_and_Morty) "Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)") and his good-hearted but fretful grandson [Morty Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morty_Smith "Morty Smith"), who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.

Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with [Chris Parnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Parnell "Chris Parnell"), [Spencer Grammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Grammer "Spencer Grammer") and [Sarah Chalke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Chalke "Sarah Chalke") voicing the rest of Rick and Morty's family. The series originated from an animated [short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film "Short film") [parody film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody_film "Parody film") of *[Back to the Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future "Back to the Future")*, created by Roiland for [Channel 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_101 "Channel 101"), a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. The series has been acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor.

The [fourth season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty_(season_4) "Rick and Morty (season 4)") premiered on November 10, 2019, and consists of ten episodes. A fifth season was confirmed in July 2020, as part of a long-term deal in May 2018 that ordered 70 new episodes over an unspecified number of seasons.[\[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty#cite_note-2)



The show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith household, which consists of parents [Jerry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_characters#Jerry_Smith "List of Rick and Morty characters") and [Beth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_characters#Beth_Smith "List of Rick and Morty characters"), their children [Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_characters#Summer_Smith "List of Rick and Morty characters") and [Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morty_Smith "Morty Smith"), and Beth's father, [Rick Sanchez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Sanchez_(Rick_and_Morty) "Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)"), who lives with them as a guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives outside of [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle "Seattle"), [Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state) "Washington (state)").[\[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty#cite_note-3) The adventures of *Rick and Morty*, however, take place across an infinite number of realities, with the characters travelling to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick's flying car.

Rick is an eccentric and alcoholic [mad scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_scientist "Mad scientist"), who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school, marriage, love, and family. He frequently goes on adventures with his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a kind-hearted but easily distressed boy, whose na√Øve but grounded moral compass plays counterpoint to Rick's [Machiavellian ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellianism_(psychology) "Machiavellianism (psychology)"). Morty's 17-year-old sister, Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries about improving her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their adventures. The kids' mother, Beth, is a generally level-headed person and assertive force in the household, though self-conscious about her professional role as a horse surgeon. She is dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry, a simple-minded and insecure person, who disapproves of Rick's influence over his family.[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

Different versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the show's [multiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction "Parallel universes in fiction") and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another. The show's original Rick identifies himself as "Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C-[137](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant "Fine-structure constant")", in reference to his original universe, but this does not necessarily apply to every other member of the Smith household. For instance, in the first-season episode "[Rick Potion #9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Potion_No._9 "Rick Potion No. 9")", after turning the entire world population into monsters, Rick and Morty move to a different dimension, leaving Summer, Beth and Jerry behind.
