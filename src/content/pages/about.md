Not much is known about Rick's life before his current state seen in the show except for a few things that have been vaguely mentioned in the series. It has been mentioned multiple times that Rick has been absent from the family for 20 years, and it wasn't until one year before the events of "Something Ricked This Way Comes" when Rick finally returned to the Smith house on January 15th. The reason for his absence is unknown to the rest of the family.

In the [Pilot](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot "Pilot") episode, Rick told Beth that he loved the eggs that she made him and that her mother would have loved them too if she was still there. In the episode [Rick Potion #9](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Rick_Potion_No._9 "Rick Potion No. 9"), it is revealed that Rick has a very pessimistic worldview, informing Morty that love is "just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed", advising him not to continue the cycle of love, marriage, and heartbreak that he had to go through and that his parents would likely go through, and instead encourages him to direct his interests towards science. This could imply that the woman he married before is either divorced and/or deceased as of now. In "The Wedding Squanchers", Rick mentions that he "couldn't make a \[marriage] work" which might imply that he is a divorcee. Whether or not his wife is dead, divorced, or both remains a mystery, but nevertheless, she is absent from his life.

Rick used to be a rock star/bassist. In the episode [Get Schwifty](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Get_Schwifty "Get Schwifty"), it was revealed that when Rick was somewhere in his college years or in his 20's, he, [Birdperson](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Birdperson "Birdperson"), and [Squanchy](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Squanchy "Squanchy") were in a rock band called "[The Flesh Curtains](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/The_Flesh_Curtains "The Flesh Curtains")". He played as the bassist in said band. However the comics contradict this in issue seven, showing him playing electric guitar. So in conclusion, he might have played both the bass and the electric guitar.

Rick is also shown to be a terrorist on an inter-galactic level. In the episode "[The Wedding Squanchers](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wedding_Squanchers "The Wedding Squanchers")", Rick willingly turned himself over to the [Galactic Federation](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Federation "Galactic Federation") and was sent to one of their maximum security prisons - he was apparently in prison for "everything". He would later orchestrate a massive escape attempt, leading to the elimination of the Council of Ricks, significant damage to [the Citadel](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/The_Citadel "The Citadel"), and the destabilization of the entire Galactic Federation's economy. In "[The Wedding Squanchers](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wedding_Squanchers "The Wedding Squanchers")," he alludes to the fact that he participated in an inter-galactic war called Battle of Blood Ridge against the Gromflomites with Birdperson. This shows that Rick is a notorious inter-galactic terrorist.

As of now, Rick is about 70 years old and currently resides in his room in the Smith house. He also uses the garage as partial living quarters. In the garage, he works on his inventions and science - for example, traveling to other dimensions, building various robots and devices, and causing general mayhem in different parts of the universe, be it dimensions, planets, or alternate realities.
